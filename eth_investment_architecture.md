# ETH Investment Script Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture for an ETH-focused investment script that provides weekly analysis and automated recommendations. The script is designed for beginners and focuses exclusively on ETH investments.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Collection Module
- **CoinGecko API Integration**
  - Fetch current ETH price data
  - Retrieve historical price data for technical analysis
  - Get market data (volume, market cap, etc.)
  - Monitor exchange-specific pricing

- **Etherscan API Integration**
  - Track gas fees
  - Monitor network activity
  - Estimate transaction costs

### 2. Technical Analysis Module
- **Price Indicators**
  - RSI (Relative Strength Index) calculation
  - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
  - Moving Averages (50-day, 200-day)
  - Volume analysis

- **Pattern Recognition**
  - Support and resistance levels
  - Trend identification
  - Golden/Death cross detection

### 3. Risk Management Module
- **Position Sizing Calculator**
  - Calculate optimal position size based on portfolio value
  - Implement maximum risk per trade (2% as default)
  - Adjust for ETH volatility

- **Stop-Loss Generator**
  - Calculate appropriate stop-loss levels
  - Implement trailing stop strategy
  - Generate take-profit targets

### 4. Weekly Analysis Workflow
- **Scheduled Analysis**
  - Run comprehensive analysis once per week
  - Generate weekly summary report
  - Compare with previous week's metrics

- **Alert System**
  - Notify of significant changes in ETH metrics
  - Flag potential buying/selling opportunities
  - Warn about high-risk conditions

### 5. Recommendation Engine
- **Decision Logic**
  - Combine technical indicators into a unified score
  - Weight indicators based on effectiveness
  - Generate clear BUY/SELL/HOLD recommendations

- **Explanation Generator**
  - Provide beginner-friendly explanations for recommendations
  - Include reasoning behind each decision
  - Suggest alternative actions when appropriate

### 6. Google Sheets Integration
- **Data Visualization**
  - Update sheets with current ETH data
  - Generate charts and graphs
  - Track performance over time

- **Portfolio Tracking**
  - Monitor current holdings
  - Calculate profit/loss
  - Project future performance

## Data Flow

1. **Weekly Trigger** - Script runs on a weekly schedule
2. **Data Collection** - Fetch current and historical ETH data
3. **Technical Analysis** - Calculate indicators and identify patterns
4. **Risk Assessment** - Evaluate current market conditions and risk levels
5. **Decision Making** - Generate investment recommendations
6. **Reporting** - Update Google Sheets and generate reports
7. **User Notification** - Provide clear, actionable information
