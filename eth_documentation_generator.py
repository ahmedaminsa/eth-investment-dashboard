# Technical Indicators Guide

This guide explains the technical indicators used in the ETH investment script in beginner-friendly terms.

## Relative Strength Index (RSI)

**What it is:** RSI measures the speed and change of price movements on a scale from 0 to 100.

**How to interpret it:**
- RSI above 70: ETH may be **overbought** (potentially overvalued)
- RSI below 30: ETH may be **oversold** (potentially undervalued)
- RSI between 30-70: ETH is in a **neutral** zone

**How we use it:** The script uses RSI to identify potential buying opportunities when ETH is oversold (RSI < 30) and potential selling opportunities when ETH is overbought (RSI > 70).

## Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

**What it is:** MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of ETH's price.

**Components:**
- MACD Line: The difference between the 12-period and 26-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)
- Signal Line: The 9-period EMA of the MACD Line
- Histogram: The difference between the MACD Line and Signal Line

**How to interpret it:**
- MACD Line crosses above Signal Line: Bullish signal (potential buy)
- MACD Line crosses below Signal Line: Bearish signal (potential sell)
- Histogram increasing: Upward momentum is strengthening
- Histogram decreasing: Downward momentum is strengthening

**How we use it:** The script uses MACD crossovers to identify potential trend changes and generate buy/sell signals.

## Moving Averages

**What it is:** Moving averages smooth out price data to create a single flowing line, making it easier to identify the direction of the trend.

**Types used:**
- Simple Moving Average (SMA): Average of prices over a specific period
- Exponential Moving Average (EMA): Weighted average that gives more importance to recent prices

**Key concepts:**
- Golden Cross: When the 50-day MA crosses above the 200-day MA (bullish signal)
- Death Cross: When the 50-day MA crosses below the 200-day MA (bearish signal)

**How to interpret it:**
- Price above MA: Uptrend
- Price below MA: Downtrend
- MA slope up: Strengthening trend
- MA slope down: Weakening trend

**How we use it:** The script uses moving averages to identify the overall trend direction and significant trend changes through golden and death crosses.

## Support and Resistance Levels

**What it is:** 
- Support: Price level where ETH tends to stop falling and bounce back up
- Resistance: Price level where ETH tends to stop rising and fall back down

**How to interpret it:**
- Price approaching support: Potential buying opportunity
- Price approaching resistance: Potential selling opportunity
- Price breaking through support: Previous support may become resistance
- Price breaking through resistance: Previous resistance may become support

**How we use it:** The script identifies support and resistance levels to determine optimal entry and exit points, as well as stop-loss levels.

## Average True Range (ATR)

**What it is:** ATR measures market volatility by decomposing the entire range of an asset price for a period.

**How to interpret it:**
- Higher ATR: Higher volatility
- Lower ATR: Lower volatility

**How we use it:** The script uses ATR to set appropriate stop-loss levels based on current market volatility rather than using fixed percentages.

## Trend Analysis

**What it is:** Trend analysis examines the direction of ETH's price movement over time.

**Types of trends:**
- Uptrend: Series of higher highs and higher lows
- Downtrend: Series of lower highs and lower lows
- Sideways/Ranging: No clear direction

**How we use it:** The script analyzes trends to determine the overall market direction and adjust investment strategies accordingly.

## Volatility

**What it is:** Volatility measures how much the price of ETH fluctuates over time.

**How to interpret it:**
- High volatility: Large price swings (higher risk and potential reward)
- Low volatility: Small price swings (lower risk and potential reward)

**How we use it:** The script measures volatility to adjust position sizing and risk management parameters.

# Risk Management Guide

This guide explains the risk management concepts used in the ETH investment script in beginner-friendly terms.

## Position Sizing

**What it is:** Position sizing determines how much ETH to buy or sell in each trade.

**Key concepts:**
- Fixed percentage risk: Risking a fixed percentage of your portfolio on each trade
- Position size calculation: Based on the distance between entry price and stop-loss

**How we calculate it:**
1. Determine the maximum amount you're willing to risk per trade (e.g., 2% of portfolio)
2. Calculate the difference between entry price and stop-loss price
3. Divide the risk amount by the price difference to get the position size in ETH

**Example:**
- Portfolio value: $10,000
- Risk per trade: 2% = $200
- Entry price: $3,000
- Stop-loss price: $2,800 (difference of $200)
- Position size: $200 รท $200 = 1 ETH

**Why it matters:** Proper position sizing ensures that no single trade can significantly damage your portfolio, allowing you to withstand a series of losing trades.

## Stop-Loss Strategies

**What it is:** A stop-loss is a predetermined price level at which you'll sell to limit potential losses.

**Types implemented:**
- Fixed percentage: Set at a fixed percentage below entry price
- ATR-based: Based on market volatility using Average True Range
- Support-based: Set at the nearest support level below entry price

**How to use it:**
- Always set a stop-loss when entering a trade
- Consider adjusting stop-loss as the trade moves in your favor (trailing stop)
- Never move a stop-loss to increase potential loss

**Why it matters:** Stop-losses protect your capital by limiting the loss on any single trade, which is crucial for long-term success.

## Take-Profit Targets

**What it is:** Take-profit targets are predetermined price levels at which you'll sell to secure profits.

**Concepts:**
- Risk-reward ratio: The ratio between potential profit and potential loss
- Multiple targets: Setting several price targets to secure partial profits

**How we calculate it:**
1. Determine the risk (entry price - stop-loss price)
2. Multiply the risk by desired risk-reward ratios (e.g., 1.5R, 2.5R, 3.5R)
3. Add the result to entry price to get take-profit targets

**Example:**
- Entry price: $3,000
- Stop-loss price: $2,800 (risk of $200)
- Take-profit targets:
  - Target 1 (1.5R): $3,000 + ($200 ร 1.5) = $3,300
  - Target 2 (2.5R): $3,000 + ($200 ร 2.5) = $3,500
  - Target 3 (3.5R): $3,000 + ($200 ร 3.5) = $3,700

**Why it matters:** Take-profit targets help you secure profits and avoid the common mistake of holding winning trades too long.

## Portfolio Exposure Limits

**What it is:** Portfolio exposure limits restrict how much of your total portfolio can be allocated to ETH.

**Key concepts:**
- Maximum exposure: The maximum percentage of your portfolio allocated to ETH
- Diversification: Spreading risk across different assets

**How we implement it:**
- Set a maximum percentage of portfolio value for ETH exposure (e.g., 25%)
- Adjust position sizes to respect this limit
- Monitor and rebalance as needed

**Why it matters:** Limiting exposure prevents concentration risk, ensuring that a significant drop in ETH price won't devastate your entire portfolio.

## Trailing Stops

**What it is:** A trailing stop is a stop-loss that moves up as the price increases, locking in profits while still allowing for further gains.

**How it works:**
1. Set initial stop-loss when entering a trade
2. As price moves favorably, adjust stop-loss to maintain a fixed percentage or amount below the highest price reached
3. Sell when price hits the trailing stop

**Example:**
- Entry price: $3,000
- Initial stop-loss: $2,800
- Price rises to $3,500
- Trailing stop (0.5% trail): $3,500 ร (1 - 0.005) = $3,482.50

**Why it matters:** Trailing stops help you capture more profit in strong trends while protecting gains if the trend reverses.

## Risk-Reward Ratio

**What it is:** The risk-reward ratio compares the potential profit of a trade to its potential loss.

**How to calculate it:**
- Risk = Entry price - Stop-loss price
- Reward = Take-profit price - Entry price
- Risk-reward ratio = Reward รท Risk

**Recommended ratios:**
- Minimum: 1:1.5 (risking $1 to potentially gain $1.50)
- Ideal: 1:2 or higher

**Why it matters:** A favorable risk-reward ratio means you can be profitable even if you're wrong more often than you're right.

## Weekly Analysis Frequency

**What it is:** The script performs a comprehensive analysis on a weekly basis rather than daily or hourly.

**Benefits:**
- Reduces noise in the data
- Minimizes overtrading
- Focuses on more significant trends
- Reduces emotional decision-making

**Why it matters:** Weekly analysis helps avoid the pitfalls of short-term market fluctuations and encourages a more disciplined approach to ETH investing.
